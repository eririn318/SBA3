# Reflection
Write a brief reflection (100-200 words) discussing:
**Challenges you encountered during the project.
**Your approach to solving these challenges.
**Improvements you would make if given more time.

    I learned to use card and grid technique. I could not apply exact of width and height, so I used inline style css. I tried to make it as similar as possible without information. If I can learn how to read all informationa and guide to find out any exact information and apply it to css will be more satisfied.
